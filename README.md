# BpExamples

Simple examples of games made with B+

## Pong

Showcases a simple game-loop, rendering with `SimpleGraphicsService`, and basic collision detection

## RayTracer

Showcases the use of various collision shapes, and techniques to use Julia for high-performance graphics.

## TextureGen

Showcases the use of Fields and GUI (our Dear ImGUI service module).

## L-System

Uses an L-system to generate a hierarchical tree-like structure.
Showcases the SceneTree system, loading of assets from files, and some interesting GUI stuff as well.

Also shows how to use Julia's array-processing features, originally intended for scientific computing,
    to hugely simplify syntax without sacrificing performance.
This array-processing syntax also helps to prototype GPU techniques on the CPU.
